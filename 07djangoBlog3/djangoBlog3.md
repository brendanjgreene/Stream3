#INTRODUCTION

At this point, we have our shiny new Bootstrap template in place showing our blog posts. As with any good blog site, we should also have the ability to display a single post. We can achieve this without too much effort because we already have our Post model in place. We also have our base template created from our last lesson challenge.

All we need to do is to create another child template that we can link from a post entry displayed in our returned list of blog posts.

Right, so let’s get stuck in.

##LEARNING OUTCOMES

Topics include:

* Create a new child template

* Link to the post detail

* Wire up the “Back to Posts” button
