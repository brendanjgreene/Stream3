#INTRODUCTION

It’s often required by a website to take subscription payments for services or continued access to a site’s content.

In this section, we’re going to take our Stripe registration payment code a step further and set a monthly payment plan up for our users, and take care of renewing their access permissions every month.

This unit assumes you have completed the previous Stripe Basic Payments unit.
