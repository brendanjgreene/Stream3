#INTRODUCTION

You’ve probably noticed throughout the last four lessons that all blog posts were added from the admin screen. This isn’t the best way to do things for two reasons; security and usability.

Security, because once someone has access to the admin page, they may inadvertently (or deliberately) modify other key data areas registered with the admin module. And usability, because a blogger really shouldn’t have to go through the back door to add a new post.

Also, a blog post should display any images required to illustrate what might be the post’s main point.

In this lesson, we’ll add a post submission form to allow users to add images to a post, and to create a new blog post form.
