#INTRODUCTION

Much of the content on the web is created by non-developers. It would be impractical to require the skills of a web developer to add a blog post or special offer to a website.

Django provides a very rudimentary module called flatpages that provides for user generated content, or to allow developers to quickly add static content.

In this lesson we will create a simple website and configure it to allow non-technical administrators to create content using flatpages. We will then use flatpages to create static pages.

#LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

* Rapidly create a web application with Django.

* Install the flatpages module and configure it.

* Use flatpages to create web content that is rarely changed.

* Navigate to templates via menu links.

* Create an About page.
