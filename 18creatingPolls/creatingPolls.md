Creating Forum Polls – Intro
In this lesson the students will learn how to integrate polls into their forum to allow their users to vote on topics

# INTRODUCTION

In the last unit, we built the basics of a forum.

In the current unit, we’re going to extend that basic set of functions to include the ability to take polls as part of a thread topic. To do this, we will continue working with the Forum project created earlier.

So let’s dive in and get to grips with how the polling process works!

# LEARNING OUTCOMES

At the end of this unit, you’ll know:

* What taking polls requires in terms of data models

* How to show parts of a Django form based on the user’s actions

* What the process of taking a poll requires to be accurate

If at any point you run into any issues with your code, you can return to this starting point by following these steps:

- In the terminal run the following commands:
    - git clone https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/we_are_social.git
    - cd we_are_social
    - git checkout forum

- Make sure you have a virtualenv setup in Pycharm. You’ll have to update the requirements.txt file by using git+https://github.com/<your github id here>/reusable_blog_app.git instead of the link that’s already there. Once that’s done you can go ahead and install the dependencies from ‘requirements.txt.’
- Run python manage.py migrate
