Hello Django! – Templates – Intro
An introduction to Django Templates

INTRODUCTION TO DYNAMIC CONTENT WITH TEMPLATES

We have so far created a project, made an app, and associated it (settings.py) with the project. By modifying the url.py and views.py, we were able to get a simple page (view) running on a development web server.

Now we’ll make our content more dynamic by using templates.

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to make content more dynamic by using templates.

Topics include:

Hello %s!

Templates

Template Philosophy

Creating A Template

Template Inheritance

Hello %s! and Templates
In this unit the students will learn the basics of Django templates

HELLO %S! AND TEMPLATES

Just before we look at templates, let’s look at how we can add variable content to a view.

Update the view you created in the last lesson with the code shown below:
#
from django.http import HttpResponse


def say_hello(request):
    name = "Bootcamper"
    html = "<html><body><h1>Hello %s!</h1></body></html>" % name
    return HttpResponse(html)
#
The function has been modified to use two variables, and the code within the view constructs an HTML response using Python’s “format-string” capability. The %s within the string is a placeholder, and the percent sign after the string means “Replace the %s placeholder in the string with the value held in the name variable.”

Start your server and test your changes. You should see something similar to below:



We can see that the text was rendered dynamically through the use of a variable and some HTML content hard-coded into our view.

 
In our next lesson, which covers Django Models, we’ll learn how to display data from a database. But for now, our data will be defined within our views.
TEMPLATES

The last example is a good illustration of how you can add dynamic content to a view. But we really shouldn’t be hard-coding HTML in our views and here’s why:

Sites are living entities and evolve over time. A site’s interfaces will probably change a lot more than its underlying Python code. By using the above approach, any design changes to the page require a change in the Python code. The design is what we call tightly coupled to the code. It would be much better if we could decouple the design elements from the underlying code.

Larger projects often involve a delegation of responsibilities amongst the development team, where each member may have a particular strength. Python coding proficiency and HTML design chops are two different disciplines, and not everyone will have a full stack skillset. For the others, we should not expect a designer to edit Python when making changes.

By separating the concerns through the use of templates, we get stuff done faster if we don’t, say, have a designer waiting on a Python developer to provide underlying functionality.

A Django template is just a text file and can generate any text-based format (HTML, XML, CSV, etc.).

Templates are used to separate the presentation of a document from its data and logic. A  template defines placeholders and logic through the use of template tags and variables that determine how the document is rendered.

TEMPLATE PHILOSOPHY

The following is taken from the Django Book:

The template system has roots in how web development is done at World Online and the combined experience of Django’s creators. Here are a few of those philosophies:

Business logic should be separated from presentation logic. Django’s developers see a template system as a tool that controls presentation and presentation-related logic, and that’s it. The template system shouldn’t support functionality that goes beyond this basic goal.

For that reason, it’s impossible to call Python code directly within Django templates. All “programming” is fundamentally limited to the scope of what template tags can do. It is possible to write custom template tags that do arbitrary things, but the out-of-the-box Django template tags intentionally do not allow for arbitrary Python code execution.

Syntax should be decoupled from HTML/XML. Although Django’s template system is used primarily to produce HTML, it’s intended to be just as usable for non-HTML formats, such as plain text. Some other template languages are XML based, placing all template logic within XML tags or attributes, but Django deliberately avoids this limitation. Requiring valid XML to write templates introduces a world of human mistakes and hard-to-understand error messages, and using an XML engine to parse templates incurs an unacceptable level of overhead in template processing.

Designers are assumed to be comfortable with HTML code. The template system isn’t designed so that templates necessarily are displayed nicely in WYSIWYG editors such as Dreamweaver. That is too severe a limitation and wouldn’t allow the syntax to be as friendly as it is. Django expects template authors to be comfortable editing HTML directly.

Designers are assumed not to be Python programmers. The template system authors recognize that Web page templates are most often written by designers, not programmers, and therefore should not assume Python knowledge.

However, the system also intends to accommodate small teams in which the templates are created by Python programmers.

The goal is not to invent a programming language. The goal is to offer just enough programming-esque functionality, such as branching and looping, that is essential for making presentation-related decisions
