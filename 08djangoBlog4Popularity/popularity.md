#INTRODUCTION

Now that our blog is nicely up and running , we’d like to find out which posts are the most popular and how many times they have been viewed. We’d also like to tag our posts to group them into categories. Finally, we’d like to allow users to add comments to blog posts.

##LEARNING OUTCOMES

* Adding a counter

* Categorize the post using tags

* Integrate comments into posts
