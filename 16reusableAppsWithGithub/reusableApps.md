# INTRODUCTION

At some point in your career, you’ll need to write a project that will use components that are more or less the same as apps you’ve already written for past projects.

On that note, let’s look at how we can make our existing apps available to us and the rest of the world as an installable module through Github.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

Topics include:

* How to restructure an app for packaging

* How to create a set of configuration files to describe how your app should be installed

* How to alter code to reflect your package’s naming scheme

* How to include the new app in your site requirements
